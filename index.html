<h1 align=center id='header'> Italian Wine by Region</h1>

<body>

    <div id="intro">
        <p>Wine was introduced to Italy during the Roman Empire. Today it is the worldâ€™s largest producer of wine at 43,829 hectolitres (2017). Largely due to the climate which provides ideal conditions for viticulture. </p>
        <p> Italy categorizes their wine in three quality standards; DOP, IGP and Vino. DOP or Protected Designation of Origin is the top tier classification which assures the wine has been processed in a strictly defined area. IGP or Protected Geographical Information is the middle tier which assures that part of the production took place in a specified region. Meanwhile, vino (wine) is the last tier which means it does not meet the strict production requirements or is outside an approved geographical region.</p>
